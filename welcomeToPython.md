# Chapter 1 - What is Python?

What is Python? Seems like a simple question, right. Well it's more convoluted than that. Lets step back, what is a programming language? At its core, a programming language is a just a special set of keywords to tell a computer what to do for a specific task.[[1]](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~krrahul/cs300/6.pdf) There are two main types of programming languages, interpreted languages, and compiled languages. (Dont worry if you dont know what that means, its alright for now.) 

Python is a interpreted language, which means it gets converted to a computer readable format when you run it (called runtime). Python is also a "high-level" and "dynamically typed" programming language. These are terms that you learn later.

# Chapter 2 - Why use Python?

There are many reasons to use Python, one of them being its an easy language to learn and get things done in! Its also used in things like:
1. AI/Machine Learning
2. Data Science
3. Automation
4. Build Websites
5. And More!

Python is a very popular language, and many companies use Python, so its a great language to learn even if its just for a Job. It looks great on an resume! Beyond its popularity, it one of the easiest languages to use to produce something, and there are Thousands of community made packages to use, so its easy to create many things. If you look around you can see Python everywhere!

While this is all true, Python isnt a perfect language, and isnt suitable for all situations. Heres why you might not want to use Python:
1. Its Very Slow. Compaired to languages like Go, Rust, or C++, and isnt suitable for very computational tasks
2. Its a high level language, which means you cant do things that something like C++ can, which is a lower level language (think like interacting directly with computer parts)
3. You cant (easily) compile Python, which means if someone else wants to use your project, they need Python installed

While there are other cons, I believe these are some of the more important ones to take note of.

# Chapter 3 -Setting Up The Enviroment

So, you want to use Python? Great! Before we can get coding, we have todo some chores.

Firstly, in order to use python, we need to download Python (duh)! You can click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for a download link. When you're downloading python, make sure to click this button:<br>

Secondly, we need to pick our code editor (often called an IDE). There are several out there, but I always reccommend two. [Vscodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Both are free (for Pycharm pick community option), and open source (meaning you can read the code). Here are some pros and cons of each:

## Vscodium
### Pros:
- Lightweight
- Supports VScode extensions/plugins
- More user friendly for beginners

### Cons:
- Less features than Pycharm

## Pycharm
### Pros:
- Very powerful, lots of features
- Lots of programming tools
- Plugin Support

### Cons:
- Not lightweight, a resource hog
- No juypter notebook support (for community version)
- Not all VScode extensions are supported on Pycharm


For most people, I think Vscodium will better for beginners, but you can choose either one. If you have used jetbrain products before, than I reccommend Pycharm, if not then Vscodium.


### For Windows, Vscodium Users
If youre using Vscodium, Id reccommend doing one last thing, using Python's package manager (pip) we should install `virtualenv`, this will help use keep our computer enviroment clean. You can do this by enter the following command inside the command prompt. (Access the command prompt pressing `WIN+R` and typing `cmd` and pressing `ENTER`)
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

This should install the package we need.


Lastly, you can watch these videos on how to use your IDEs:
### [Pycharm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VmNuqfavF4)
### Vscodium:
1. [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=197JAS1gNKo)
2. [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZbeL5AcTgw)

If youre watching the Vscodium tutorials, please watch both videos (theyre short, I promise)

# Chapter 4 - Basic Concepts
Congrats, youve made it through probably the most boring part of this whole thing! Now we can get to the fun part, CODING!
